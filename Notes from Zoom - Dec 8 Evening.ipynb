    "*Results: Describing the overall model metrics and feature coefficients\n",
    "You need at least **one overall model metric (e.g. r-squared or RMSE) and at least two feature coefficients.**\n",
    "For a business audience, make sure you connect any metrics to real-world implications. You do not need to get into the details of how linear regression works.\n",
    "For a data science audience, you don't need to explain what a metric is, but make sure you explain why you chose that particular one.*\n",

    "* Goal: we want to find the factors that have been associated with high sale prices over the past year.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What characteristics of a house's living space are most associated with increased prices?\n",
    "   * Does increasing the number of features you have always increase the house's sale price? Or, does your return on investment lower after a certain amount of features?\n",
    " \n",
    "2. Which zip codes - where you can invest in housing at a reasonable price - are the most associated with higher sale prices?\n",
    "    * What neighborhoods are \"up & coming?\" Where can you still buy for cheap and expect to return a profit in a few years?\n",

    "What about the problem or data is suitable for this form of analysis?*\n",
    "   \n",
    "Real estate investments are complex– multiple factors work together to influence value.\n",
    "It’s a luck of the draw as to what combination of features you’ll find in the market. So, there’s always going to be trade-offs.\n",
